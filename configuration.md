**configuration** a configuration is the functional and physical characteristics of a hardware or software set forth in technical documentation or achieved in a product. 

#### configuration management 
1. **configuration identification** define the product & its configuration documentation identification
2. **change management** control changes to a product & its configuration documentation
3. **configuration sales accounting** provide status & information about a product & its configuration documentation. 
4. **configuration audits** 

configuration management is the process of coordinating the software development by tracking, modifying & controlling changes to the software. 

#### why software config management is important. 
Software config is important because new versions of software systems are created as they get changed for different OS 
diff. functionalities that aren't present in the previous version might be needed. 

config management is responsible for managing & controlling the costs & efforts involved in making changes to a system. 


#### software config management. (SCM)
SCM defines. 
- the types of documents to be managed & a document naming scheme
- who takes responsibility for the CM procedures and creation of *baselines*. 
- policies for change control and version management. 
- the CM records which must be maintained. 

A baselines is a formally reviewed and approved document by the management that can be used as the basis for further development. 

SCM specifies the tools which should be used to assist the CM process and any limitations on their use. 

#### effectiveness of SCM
SCM is said to be effective
- when every work product can be accounted for
- when every work product or change made to it can be tracked and controlled.

#### Configuration item (CI). 
A configuration item is an aggregation of the hardware, software or both, that is designated for configuration management and treated as single entity in CM process. 
Document naming scheme must be defined so that related documents might have related names


#### types of configuration objects
to manage SCI(software configuration Item) they must be separately named & organised using Object Oriented approach. 
- **base object** 
	- a base object is the *unit of text* that has been created by a software engineer during analysis, code, design or test
	- *ex.*
		- section of a requirement specification. 
		- a source listing for a component. 
		- a suite of test cases that are used to exercise code. 
- **aggregate object**
	- collection of base objects & other aggregate objects. 
	- *ex.*
		- design specification is an aggregate object which comprises Data design, Architectural design, module design, interface design. 


#### relationship b/w configuration objects
- curved arrow indicates a compositional relation. 
- double-headed straight arrow indicates an interrelationship

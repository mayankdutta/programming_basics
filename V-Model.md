- Verification & validation model commonly known as V-Model. 
- evolved from waterfall. 
- each phase must be completed before the next begins. 
- *testing* is emphasised more than waterfall. 
- structured approach to testing. 
- Testing done in earlier stage thereby bringing high quality to dev of products.

##### Adv
- validation & verification at each level of stage containment. 
- avoids downward flow of defect. 
- lower defect resolution cost due to earlier detection. 
- allow tester to be active from initial state of the project life cycle. 

##### Dis-adv
- least flexible. 
- rigid
- backtracking cost is still high. 
- increased dev time & cost. 
- hard to estimate costs & project overruns.

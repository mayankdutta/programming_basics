Reasons for software change
- new requirements emerge when software is used. 
- business environment changes
- performance or reliability needs to be improved. 
- software needs to be adapted to new technological upgrades. 

strategies for software changes, such as 
- software maintenance 
- architectural transformation
- software re-engineering 

##### software maintenance 
- changes are made in response to changed requirements but the fundamental software structure is stable. 
- process of modifying a software system or component after delivery to correct faults, improve performance. 

##### Architectural transformation 
- generally change from a centralized to a distributed architecture. 

##### Software re-engineering 
- no new functionality is added to system. 
- it is restructured & reorganized to facilitate future changes. 

#### types of maintenance. 
- **corrective** concerned with fixing errors, observed when the software is in the use. 
- **adaptive** 
	- involves adapting the software to changes in the working env. 
	- it is concerned with the changes to be made to a software to make it adaptable to a new environment. 
	- for ex. govt changed VAT to X percent. This change means that many organisation had to make alternations to their system. 
- **perfective** 
	- making functional enhancements to the system. 
	- which increase system's performance even when changes haven't been suggested by faults. 
	- ex. A report is generated in excel format, for better understanding it is generated in graphical manner.
- **preventive** 
	- changes made to system to prevent occurrence of errors in future. 
	- prevent problems before they occur.

Reasons for software change
- new requirements emerge when software is used. 
- business environment changes
- performance or reliability needs to be improved. 
- software needs to be adapted to new technological upgrades. 

strategies for software changes, such as 
- software maintenance 
- architectural transformation
- software re-engineering 

##### software maintenance 
- changes are made in response to changed requirements but the fundamental software structure is stable. 
- process of modifying a software system or component after delivery to correct faults, improve performance. 

##### Architectural transformation 
- generally change from a centralized to a distributed architecture. 

##### Software re-engineering 
- no new functionality is added to system. 
- it is restructured & reorganized to facilitate future changes. 

#### types of maintenance. 
- **corrective** concerned with fixing errors, observed when the software is in the use. 
- **adaptive** 
	- involves adapting the software to changes in the working env. 
	- it is concerned with the changes to be made to a software to make it adaptable to a new environment. 
	- for ex. govt changed VAT to X percent. This change means that many organisation had to make alternations to their system. 
- **perfective** 
	- making functional enhancements to the system. 
	- which increase system's performance even when changes haven't been suggested by faults. 
	- ex. A report is generated in excel format, for better understanding it is generated in graphical manner.
- **preventive** 
	- changes made to system to prevent occurrence of errors in future. 
	- prevent problems before they occur. 

*most of the time is spent on the maintenance activity*

when a change request comes, CCB first does an impact analysis where the change is either aceptedd or rejected.

If the change is accepted, then it moves to the systme realease planning where change requests is analyzed and mapped to a particular type of maintenance. 

The changes are then implemented and released. maintenance cost are greater than the development cost 2 to 100 times.
Aging software can have high support cost. 
ex. old languages, compilers.

cost is affected by both technical & non-technical factors.

- white box testing method. 
- design test cases to cover the following in the code written. 
	- *every statement (statement coverage).*
	- *every predicate in the code (condition OR branch coverage).*  if/else thing 
	- *loops (loop coverage).*  loop executed 0/1/n times. 
- To perform basis path testing. 
	- break modules into blocks deliminated by statements that affect the control flow. 
	- mark out these as nodes in control flow graph.
	- draw connectors with arrow heads to mark the flow of logic
	- identify the regions (cyclomatic number) which is also known as McCabe's number.
- McCabe's number (cyclomatic complexity)
	- defines the no. of independent paths. 
	- provides the no. of tests that must be conducted to ensure that all the statements are executed at least once.

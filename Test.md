The provided requirement, "The stock exchange shall show the stock report for the next 24 hours," is **incomplete** and **ambiguous**.

Here's why:

1. **Incomplete**: The requirement lacks important details such as what should be included in the stock report (e.g., specific stocks, data points, format), how often it should be updated, and where it should be displayed (e.g., on a website, a mobile app, or a physical display). These details are necessary for the development team to understand and implement the requirement accurately.
    
2. **Ambiguous**: The phrase "show the stock report for the next 24 hours" is not clear in its intent. It's unclear whether this means showing data for the next 24 hours continuously or if it refers to a daily report that covers the next 24 hours. The lack of clarity could lead to misunderstandings and different interpretations among stakeholders and developers.
    

Therefore, the correct option is **d. Ambiguous**.

The requirement as described appears to be **inconsistent**.

Here's why:

In the same process, it states that when the fuel level goes below the minimum level, the application should indicate the user in **red color**, but in the output section, it mentions that the indicator will glow **pink**. This is a contradiction because the colors red and pink are different.

So, the correct option is **b. Contradicting**.

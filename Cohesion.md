- refers to dependence within & among the same module's internal elements. (e.g., data, functions, internal modules)
- Greater the cohesion, the better is the program design.

#### Co-incidental Cohesion 
module performs multiple, completely unrelated actions. 

![[attachments/Pasted image 20230914034230.png]]

above operations are unrelated to each other. 
#### Logical Cohesion
- elements perform similar tasks & the activities to be executed are chosen from outside the module. 
- operations are related but the functions are significantly different.

#### Temporal cohesion
- module's data & function are related because they are used at the same time in an execution. 
- elements are grouped by when they are processed.

#### Procedural 
- similar to temporal, & functions pertain to some related action or purpose. 
- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20230914025501.png]]

#### Communicational 
module which has activities executed sequentially and work on same data. 

![[attachments/Pasted image 20230914025547.png]]

#### sequential 
elements are involved in activities such that output data from one activity becomes input to next activity. 

![[attachments/Pasted image 20230914025716.png]]

#### Functional 
- module performs exactly one action. 
- highly recommended form of cohesion.

- is the process of defining, documenting & maintaining the requirements for a software project to be successful. 
- very critical process. 
- The requirements are documented in a standard document called *SRS(software requirements specification)* 
- This document serves as a contract b/w the customer & developer. 
- Involves the following activities. 
	- Requirements elicitation. 
	- Requirements analysis. 
	- Requirements documentation #todo (specfication). 
	- Requirements Review.

#### Elicitation (evoke / draw out)
- process of gathering requirements of the users, customers and other stakeholders. 
- 3 categories. 
	- *address problems of scope :* boundary of system is ill defined, requirements may be too less, too much, unnecessary. 
	- *address problems of understanding (unclear objectives) :* user himself not clear about his needs, might specify the requirements that are ambiguous, analyst may later come if requirements are conflicting. 
	- *address problems of volatility (changing requirements) :*  maybe due to politics, market change or user might have missed some requirements. 

#### Requirement analysis
is the process of studying and analysing the customer, and the user needs to arrive at a clear, complete, consistent, unambiguous requirement understanding. 

#### Why this is difficult. 
- misunderstanding b/w analyst and user. 
- customer doesn't understand alternative trade-offs. 

#### Goals of requirement analysis 
- understand the user's need. 
- removing inconsistencies, anomalies from requirements.
- document, requirements properly in an SRS document.

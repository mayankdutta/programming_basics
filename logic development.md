### Characteristics of a good program. 

1. **Readability:** If it makes other programmers to follow the logic of the program without much effort. 
2. **Maintainability:** Program must evolve to meet changing needs. 
3. **Robustness:** Program is considered as Robust. If it has the ability to cope with errors during input/execution.
4. **Efficiency:** utilizes the least amount of memory and processing time. 
5. **Documentation:** must provide good documentation, should give comprehensive procedural description of program. 
6. **Modularity:** if it divides into independent parts which can be modified & maintained easily. 


### Correctness vs robustness 
A program is correct, if it accomplishes the task that it was designed to perform. 
A program is robust, if it can handle illegal inputs & other unexpected situations in a reasonable way.

### Coupling & Cohesion 

- Modules in themselves are not 'good' - we must design them to have good properties. 
- Properties of good design. 
	- Component indendence. 
	- Fault prevention & fault tolerance. 
	- design for change. 
- With Poor module design.
	- hard to understand.
	- hard to locate faults.
	- difficult to extend or enhance. 
- With good module design. 
	- maximal relationships within modules. (*cohesion*).
	- minimal relationships between modules. (*coupling*).
- There should be
	- High cohesion within the modules. 
	- Loose coupling between modules.

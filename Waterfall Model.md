- *or* linear sequential model 
- *most used, traditional model.* 
- proposed by Winston Royce in 1970. 
- name due to cascading effect from one phase to the other. 
- each phase has a well defined start & end point, with identifiable deliverables *as inputs* to the next phase. 
- linear sequential model, systematic in approach & principle suggests *Can't retrieve to previous phase*.
- *Requirements* -> *design* -> *implementation* -> *verification* -> *maintenance*.  

##### Adv
- simple easy to use. 
- easy to mange due to rigidity of the model - each phase has specific deliverables & review process. 
- phases are processed and completed one @time. 
- good for *smaller projects*. 
- linear approach. 
- *equal importance* all phases. 
- contract related issues can be addressed effectively. 

##### Limitation
- suitable if the requirement is well-defined, *stable*, *freeze*. 
- user can only see the software at the end of the development cycle. 
- backtracking cost is *high*, *reiteration* is very costly. 
- increased development of time & cost. 
- Requirements have to be freeze It is rigid. 
- hard to estimate cost. 

##### Suitable when 
- When a new version of existing system is created
	- that is when we want to automate the manual process
	- tools, techs are known in advance & not going to be changed.
- requirements are clearly defined & known. 
- product definition is stable. 
- dev tools & tech well known.

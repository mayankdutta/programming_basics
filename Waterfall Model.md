- *or* linear sequential model 
- proposed by Winston Royce in 1970. 
- name due to cascading effect from one phase to the other. 
- each phase has a well defined start & end point, with identifiable deliverables to the next phase. 
- linear sequential model, systematic in approach & principle suggests *Can't retrieve to previous phase*.
- Requirements -> design -> implementation -> verification -> maintenance.  

##### Adv
- simple easy to use. 
- easy to mange due to rigidity of the model - each phase has specific deliverables & review process. 
- phases are processed and completed one @time. 
- good for *smaller projects*. 
- linear approach. 
- *equal importance* all phases. 
- contract related issues can be addressed effectively. 

##### Limitation
- suitable if the requirement is well-defined & *stable*. 
- user can only see the software at the end of the development cycle. 
- backtracking cost is *high*. 
- increased development of time & cost. 
- Requirements have to be freeze It is rigid. 
- hard to estimate cost. 

##### Suitable when 
- requirements are clearly defined & known. 
- product definition is stable. 
- dev tools & tech well known.

types of requirements. 
- functional 
- non-functional 

#### functional
are those which describe the behaviour of the system. 

#### non-functional 
are those which specifies the quality attribute & constraints that needs to be import on the system. 


*for example :* A pen may have FR that it can write. 
A pen may have non-FR that what is it's colour, quality of the nib. 


### Requirements engineering 
- is the process of defining, documenting & maintaining the requirements for a software project to be successful. 
- very critical process. 
- The requirements are documented in a standard document called *SRS(software requirements specification)* 
- This document serves as a contract b/w the customer & developer. 
- Involves the following activities. 
	- Requirements elicitation. 
	- Requirements analysis. 
	- Requirements documentation. 
	- Requirements Review.

#### Elicitation (evoke / draw out)
- process of gathering requirements of the users, customers and other stakeholders. 
- 3 categories. 
	- *address problems of scope :* boundary of system is ill defined, requirements may be too less, too much, unnecessary. 
	- *address problems of understanding (unclear objectives) :* user himself not clear about his needs, might specify the requirements that are ambiguous, analyst may later come if requirements are conflicting. 
	- *address problems of volatility (changing requirements) :*  maybe due to politics, market change or user might have missed some requirements. 

#### Requirement analysis
is the process of studying and analysing the customer, and the user needs to arrive at a clear, complete, consistent, unambiguous requirement understanding. 


#### Why this is difficult. 
- misunderstanding b/w analyst and user. 
- customer doesn't understand alternative trade-offs. 


#### Goals of requirement analysis 
- understand the user's need. 
- removing inconsistencies, anomalies from requirements.
- document, requirements properly in an SRS document. 



### Requirement analysis 
A person who performs requirement analysis is called a system analyst. 
- understands user requirement. 
- collects data needed for the user requirement.
- writes the **SRS**. 

#### Two main activities. 
- requirement gathering. 
	- observations of existing systems. 
	- studying existing procedures. 
	- discussion with the customer and the end-user. 
	- having questionnaires to understand user requirements. 
	- conducting discussion with domain experts to understand the system. 
- analysis of gathered requirements. 

##### Several things about project should be clearly understood by the analyst. 
- what is the problem. 
- why it is important to solve the problem. 
- possible solutions of the problem. 
- complexities might arise while solving the problem. 

#### SRS concentrates on 
- Once requirements are gathered & analyzed, they can be specified in the document. 
- *SRS main aim* of this document is to systematically organize the gathered requirements in a formal specific. 
- SRS only contains what needs to be done, doesn't involve the implementation details. 
- The answer to how to implement will be provided in the **Design Phase**.

#### SRS document is useful in various contexts
- SRS will be reviewed and signed off by the stakeholder and feedback will be given. 
- It should be in easily readable by the people with little or no technical knowledge. 
- it serves as a reference document definition for implementation. 
- statement of user needs.
- it is a contract between the development team and the customer. 

#### Properties of a good SRS 
- concise, easy to change.
- specify what to do (not how to do). 
- consistent (no two require should conflict). 
- traceable (trace which part of specification/designs corresponds to)
- verifiable. (iff there exists a finite process with which we can ensure that product meets the requirement). 
- *example :* system should be user friendly isn't verifiable because it is impossible to define the terms *good*, *well* or *usually*.

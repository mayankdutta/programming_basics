**Software process :** A process of definable, repeatable & measurable tasks leading to a useful result. 

#### Ad-hoc software development
- software were developed on a trial & error basis.
- no specific process was followed during development of product. 
- defects were detected only after the product was delivered to users.

**Software Engineering is defined as**
- systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation & maintenance of software as per IEEE. 
- establishment & use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain an economical software that is reliable & works efficiently on real machine. 
### Software crisis 
- fails to meet user requirements. 
- crashes frequently. 
- development becomes expensive. 
- difficult to alter, debug & enhance.
- often delivered late. 
- use resources non-optimally. 

**Software development process** involves transformation of user need into an effective software solution. 

client's needs are analysed.

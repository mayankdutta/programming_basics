- The whole requirement is divided into various builds. 
- Multiple development cycles takes place & each cycle is divided into small manageable units called modules. 
- Each module undergo analysis, design, coding & testing. 
- Working version is produced during the first module & each release adds new functionality to the product release. 

#### Advantages 
- uses divide and conquer breakdown of tasks. 
- *high risk or major functions are addressed in the first incremental cycles.*
- each release delivers an operational product. 
- customer can respond to each build 
- customer get important functionality early. 

#### Limit
- requires early definition of a complete & fully functional system 
- requires good planning and design as basic for the system 
- absence of a well-defined module interface is a major obstacle for this model of development. 

#### when to use. 
- requirements are known up-front but are expected to evolve over time. 
- when projects have lengthy development schedules.

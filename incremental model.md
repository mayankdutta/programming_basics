- The whole requirement is divided into *various builds*. 
- Multiple development cycles takes place & each cycle is divided into small *manageable units* called *modules*. 
- Each module undergo analysis, design, coding & testing. 
- *Working version* is produced during the first module & each release adds *new functionality* to the product release. 

#### Advantages 
- uses divide and conquer breakdown of tasks(tasks not done parallelly, only divided). 
- *high risk or major functions are addressed in the first incremental cycles.*
- each release delivers an operational product. 
- customer can respond to each build 
- customer get important functionality early. 
- *Reversible* for any issue/change can go back, and reiterate entire process. 

#### Limit
- requires early definition of a complete & fully functional system 
- requires good planning and design as basic for the system 
- absence of a well-defined module interface is a major obstacle for this model of development. 

#### when to use. 
- requirements are known up-front but are expected to evolve over time. 
- when projects have lengthy development schedules.

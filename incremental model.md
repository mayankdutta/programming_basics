- prioritizes requirements of system and implements them in groups. 
- each subsequent release of system adds function to the prev. release, until all designed functionalities have been implemented. 
#### adv
- uses divide and conquer breakdown of tasks. 
- high risk or major functions are addressed in the first incremental cycles. 
- each release delivers an operational product. 
- customer can respond to each build 
- customer get important functionality early. 

#### limit
- requires early definition of a complete & fully functional system 
- requires good planning and design as basic for the system 
- absence of a well-defined module interface is a major obstacle for this model of development. 

#### when to use. 
- requirements are known up-front but are expected to evolve over time. 
- when projects have lengthy development schedules.

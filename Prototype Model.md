Prototype is the concept of developing a model or sample for the system to be built. 

- let the user feel of the system and helps the client to better understand the requirements of desired system. 
- used by end users to describe & prove requirements that the devs haven't considered. 
- dev *build a prototype* during requirement phase. 
- *evaluated by end user* to provide corrective feedback. 
- dev further *refine the prototype* based on feedback 
- when user is satisfied, prototype code is brought up to the standards needed for the final product. 

#### Steps 
- identifying the basic requirements 
- develop initial prototype. 
- review the prototype
- revise and enhance prototype. 

## Types 
#### Throw away
##### Model  (unclear requirements)

> A small part of the system is developed & then given to the user to try out and evaluate. The user then provides the feedback which can quickly be incorporated into the development of the main system.
> 
> The prototype is then discarded or thrown away. 

- quick and dirty approach; because the intention of this model is to make the *unclear requirements clear* after which *prototype is discarded* & *dev starts from scratch*. 
- focus on rapid construction. 
- discards prototypes after objective met. 

##### Steps 
- write preliminary steps. 
- design the prototype. 
- user use the prototype, specifies new requirements. 
- writing final requirement. 
- rapid construction 

##### Example
- client explains a particular layout for his UI.
- dev not able to understand the client idea.
- dev will make a rough prototype and shows it to the client till he is satisfied. 
- Its like making a draft. 

#### Evolutionary 
##### Model (unstable requirement)
- requirements prioritised & code is developed for stable requirement, with an eye on quality. 
- software is developed incrementally.
- software continuously refined and augmented in close collaboration with the client
- adopt a rigorous, systematic approach. 
- iterative mode (software is developed through repeated cycles) & in smaller portions of the time. 

> An initial prototype is presented to the user. They provide feedback & suggestions for improvements. Suggestions are refined by the dev, who then presents a more refined prototype. The user again provides a feedback. 
> 
> This process is repeated. 


##### Example 
- measurements of the shirt stitched from dealer. 
- shirt is not the right fit. 
- give shirt back to dealer and make alterations
- start the system with stable requirements, then build the system iteratively & incrementally.
#### Adv 

- faster and less expensive because the user needs are determined early removes misunderstanding & miscommunications. 
- active user involvement. 
- client gets the feel of product early in the project life cycle. 
- steady, visible signs of progress produced. 
- interaction with the prototype stimulates awareness of additional needed functionality. 


#### dis-adv
- user might get confused with the prototype model and the finished product. 
- documentation is absent because the primary focus is only on developing the prototype. 
- cost of prototyping will be high. 
- dev's attachment to the prototype. 

#### when to use. 
- requirements are unclear (*use throwaway model*)
- requirements are unstable (*use evolutionary prototype model*)

- creates prototypes, which is an incomplete version of software program being deployed. 
- simulates only few aspects of the features of the system to be built. 


- used by end users to describe & prove requirements that the devs haven't considered. 
- dev build a prototype during requirement phase. 
- evaluated by end user to provide corrective feedback. 
- dev further refine the prototype based on feedback 
- when user is satisfied, prototype code is brought up to the standards needed for the final product. 

#### Steps 
- identifying the basic requirements 
- develop initial prototype. 
- review 
- revise and enhance prototype. 


## Types 
#### Throw away
##### Model 
- quick and dirty approach; involving quick requirements asesment, analysis
#### Evolutionary

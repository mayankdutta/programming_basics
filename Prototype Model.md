Prototype is the concept of developing a model or sample for the system to be built. 

- let the user feel of the system and helps the client to better understand the requirements of desired system. 


- used by end users to describe & prove requirements that the devs haven't considered. 
- dev build a prototype during requirement phase. 
- evaluated by end user to provide corrective feedback. 
- dev further refine the prototype based on feedback 
- when user is satisfied, prototype code is brought up to the standards needed for the final product. 

#### Steps 
- identifying the basic requirements 
- develop initial prototype. 
- review the prototype
- revise and enhance prototype. 


## Types 
#### Throw away
##### Model  (unclear requirements)
- quick and dirty approach; involving quick requirements assessment, analysis, design. 
- focus on rapid construction. 
- discards prototypes after objective met. 

##### Steps (unstable requirement)
- write preliminary steps. 
- design the prototype. 
- user use the prototype, specifies new requirements. 
- writing final requirement. 
- rapid construction 
#### Evolutionary 

##### Model 
- requirements prioritised & code is developed for stable requirement, with an eye on quality. 
- software continuously refined and augmented in close collaboration with the client
- build the software incrementally. 
- adopt a rigorous, systematic approach. 
- iterative mode. 

#### Adv 

- reduce time & cost. 
- active user involvement. 
- client gets the feel of product early in the project life cycle. 
- steady, visible signs of progress produced. 
- interaction with the prototype stimulates awareness of additional needed functionality. 


#### dis-adv
- user might get confused with the prototype model and the finished product. 
- documentation is absent. 
- expense of implementing the prototype is high, affecting dev costs. 
- dev's attachment to the prototype. 

#### when to use. 
- requirements are unclear (*use throwaway model*)
- requirements are unstable (*use evolutionary prototype model*)

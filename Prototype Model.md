Prototype is the concept of developing a model or sample for the system to be built. 

- let the user feel of the system and helps the client to better understand the requirements of desired system. 
- used by end users to describe & prove requirements that the devs haven't considered. 
- dev *build a prototype* during requirement phase. 
- *evaluated by end user* to provide corrective feedback. 
- dev further *refine the prototype* based on feedback 
- when user is satisfied, prototype code is brought up to the standards needed for the final product. 

#### Steps 
- identifying the basic requirements 
- develop initial prototype. 
- review the prototype
- revise and enhance prototype. 

## Types 
#### Throw away
##### Model  (unclear requirements)

> A small part of the system is developed & then given to the user to try out and evaluate. The user then provides the feedback which can quickly be incorporated into the development of the main system.
> 
> The prototype is then discarded or thrown away. 

- quick and dirty approach; because the intention of this model is to make the *unclear requirements clear* after which *prototype is discarded* & *dev starts from scratch*. 
- focus on rapid construction. 
- discards prototypes after objective met. 

##### Steps 
- write preliminary steps. 
- design the prototype. 
- user use the prototype, specifies new requirements. 
- writing final requirement. 
- rapid construction 

##### Example
- client explains a particular layout for his UI.
- dev not able to understand the client idea.
- dev will make a rough prototype and shows it to the client till he is satisfied. 
- Its like making a draft. 


#### Evolutionary 
##### Model (unstable requirement)
- requirements prioritised & code is developed for stable requirement, with an eye on quality. 
- software is developed incrementally.
- software continuously refined and augmented in close collaboration with the client
- adopt a rigorous, systematic approach. 
- iterative mode (software is developed through repeated cycles) & in smaller portions of the time. 

> An initial prototype is presented to the user. They provide feedback & suggestions for improvements. Suggestions are refined by the dev, who then presents a more refined prototype. The user again provides a feedback. 
> 
> This process is repeated. 


##### Example 
- measurements of the shirt stitched from dealer. 
- shirt is not the right fit. 
- give shirt back to dealer and make alterations
- start the system with stable requirements, then build the system iteratively & incrementally.
#### Adv 

- faster and less expensive because the user needs are determined early removes misunderstanding & miscommunications. 
- active user involvement. 
- client gets the feel of product early in the project life cycle. 
- steady, visible signs of progress produced. 
- interaction with the prototype stimulates awareness of additional needed functionality. 


#### dis Adv
- user might get confused with the prototype model and the finished product. 
- documentation is absent because the primary focus is only on developing the prototype. 
- cost of prototyping will be high. 
- dev's attachment to the prototype. 

#### when to use. 
- requirements are unclear (*use throwaway model*)
- requirements are unstable (*use evolutionary prototype model*


### further theory 

a single prototype that is iterated over and over
throwaway prototypes are not intended to evolve into the final product design but are instead created solely for testing a single idea or answering individual questions.

Evolutionary app prototyping (*or incremental app prototyping*) is the process of creating a prototype for an app that is intended as the first iteration of the final product which can then be updated and adapted as the design project matures.


**Evolutionary** is a robust prototype, that is constantly refined to represent a product change, future product.
tend to be an expensive investment that are common in domains such as automotive industry that require products to be extremely refined before they hit the market. 

**Throwaway prototype** is a cheap, fast prototype designed to model an idea or feature. 
They are commonly used in early phases of design when a *large number of ideas are still considered*.

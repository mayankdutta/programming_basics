**Program :** A computer program is sequence of instructions written to perform a specified task in a computer. 
**Software :** set of programs, procedures & documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system. 
**Software process :** A process of definable, repeatable & measurable tasks leading to a useful result. 


#### Ad-hoc software development
- software were developed on a trial & error basis.
- no specific process was followed during development of product. 
- defects were detected only after the product was delivered to users.

**Software Engineering is defined as**
- systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation & maintenance of software. 
- establishment & use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain an economical software that is reliable & works efficiently on real machine. 
### Software crisis 
- fails to meet user requirements. 
- crashes frequently. 
- development becomes expensive. 
- difficult to alter, debug & enhance.
- often delivered late. 
- use resources non-optimally. 

**Software development process** involves transformation of user need into an effective software solution. 

### SDLC 
- process used in a project to develop a software product. 
- describes how the development activities are performed and how the development phases follow each other.

### Phases of SDLC

#### Analysis 
- goal is to define requirement of the system. 
- SRS(*software requirement specification*) is the primary artifact of Analysis phase. 


#### Design 
- software designs = 
  transforming the customer requirements -> set of documents suitable for implementing in a programming language. 
- process of defining the architecture, interface, component & other characteristics of a system. 

#### levels of design 
- decompose the entire project into units/modules & identify the system architecture, data structure & processing logic. 
- DD (design document) = HLD + LLD

#### Construction (code + unit testing) 
- modular & subsystem programming.

#### Testing 
- levels of testing
	- unit 
	- integration 
	- system 
	- acceptance
- software testing includes. 
	- *verification*  software meets its technical specification. 
	- *validation* soft. meets its business requirements. 
	- *Defect* variance b/w expected & actual result.


#### Maintenance 
Any change that is made to the software after it is deployed is known as its maintenance. 

### SDLC methods
#### Waterfall method
- proposed by Winston Royce in 1970. 
- name due to cascading effect from one phase to the other. 
- each phase has a well defined start & end point, with identifiable deliverables to the next phase. 
- linear sequential model, systematic in approach & principle suggests *Can't retrieve to previous phase*.
- Requirements -> design -> implementation -> verification -> maintenance.  

##### Adv
- simple easy to use. 
- easy to mange due to rigidity of the model - each phase has specific deliverables & review process. 
- phases are processed and completed one @time. 
- good for smaller projects. 
- linear approach. 
- equal importance @all phases. 
- contract related issues can be addressed effectively. 

##### Limitation
- suitable if the requirement is well-defined & stable. 
- backtracking cost is high. 
- increased development of time & cost. 
- It is rigid. 
- hard to estimate cost. 

##### Suitable when 
- requirements are clearly defined & known. 
- product definition is stable. 
- dev tools & tech well known.

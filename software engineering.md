**Program :** A computer program is sequence of instructions written to perform a specified task in a computer. 
**Software :** set of programs, procedures & documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system. 
**Software process :** A process of definable, repeatable & measurable tasks leading to a useful result. 

#### Ad-hoc software development
- software were developed on a trial & error basis.
- no specific process was followed during development of product. 
- defects were detected only after the product was delivered to users.

**Software Engineering is defined as**
- systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation & maintenance of software as per IEEE. 
- establishment & use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain an economical software that is reliable & works efficiently on real machine. 
### Software crisis 
- fails to meet user requirements. 
- crashes frequently. 
- development becomes expensive. 
- difficult to alter, debug & enhance.
- often delivered late. 
- use resources non-optimally. 

**Software development process** involves transformation of user need into an effective software solution. 

## SDLC 

- process used in a project to develop a software product. 
- describes how the development activities are performed and how the development phases follow each other.

### Phases of SDLC

- **feasibility :** identify the issues that may be difficult or impossible to implement in terms of cost time tech during analysis phase.  
- **analysis :** 
- **design :** helps in specifying hardware & system requirements & also helps in defining overall system architecture. 
- **Coding / implement :** design is converted into workable solution
- **test :** to find errors in the software. 
- **maintain :** After the deployment client can come back with changes or enhancements

#### Analysis 
- , *analyst* is responsible for defining the requirements of the system without bothering about how these requirements will be built. 
- goal is to define requirement of the system. 
- SRS(*software requirement specification*) is the document prepare after the analysis phase. 

##### SRS
all possible *requirements* of the system to be developed are *captured & documented* in a document called SRS during design system design is prepared based on the SRS system. 

#### Design 
- software designs = 
  *transforming the customer requirements* -> *set of documents suitable for implementing in a programming language.*
- process of defining the architecture, interface, component & other characteristics of a system. 
- various designs artifacts can be there, such as 
	- functional hierarchy
	- diagrams
	-  screen layout diagrams
	- normalised tables
	- pseudocode. 

##### Levels of design 
- decompose the entire project into units/modules & identify the system architecture, data structure & processing logic. 
- DD (design document) = HLD + LLD
- **HLD :** focuses on 
	- what modules are required, 
	- what each module perform, 
	- how these modules communicate with each other. 
- **LLD :**  focuses on
	- writing a detailed algorithm
	- module design & data design 

#### Construction (code + unit testing) 
- modular & subsystem programming.

#### Testing 
- levels of testing
	- **Unit :** done by dev, individual module tested for functionality. 
	- **System :** whole system is check.
	- **Integration :** to check the interface error b/w the integrated components. 
	- **Acceptance :** done by end-user for system acceptance. 

- software testing includes. 
	- *verification*  software meets its technical specification. ensures that we are doing the product right? 
	- *validation* software meets its customer/business requirements. ensures that we re doing the right product. 
	- *Defect* variance b/w expected & actual result.

#### Maintenance 
- Any change that is made to the software after it is deployed is known as its maintenance. 
- changes like enhancements, up-gradations.

### Phases of SDLC

- **feasibility :** (*possible to do*) identify the issues that may be difficult or impossible to implement in terms of cost time tech during analysis phase.  
- **analysis :** 
- **design :** helps in specifying hardware & system requirements & also helps in defining overall system architecture. 
- **Coding / implement :** design is converted into workable solution
- **test :** to find errors in the software. 
- **maintain :** After the deployment client can come back with changes or enhancements

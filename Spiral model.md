- tick in the box model. 
- proposed by Barry Bohem in 1986. 
- Diagrammatic representation of this model appears like *spiral with many loops*. 
- Spiral model is a framework & best suited for the projects which are *risky*. 
- has full phases such as planning, risk analysis, engineering & evaluation. 
- The software project repeatedly passes through these phases in a spiral formation. 
- Spiral combines feature of prototyping + waterfall. 
- favoured for large, expensive & complicated models. 
- suggested for high risk scenarios based projects.

Requirements are gathered during the planning phase, The risk are identified and alternate solutions are suggested, during engineering phase software is developed and tested. During evaluation customer check for the product before it goes for next spiral. 
#### Adv 
- provides early indication risk, high risk analysation done at each phase.
- users see the system early because of rapid prototyping tools. 
- critical high-risk functions are developed first.
- early and frequent feedback from users. 

#### Limitations 

- not suitable for low risks or small projects. 
- time spent for evaluating risks are too large for small or low-risks projects, may not prove cost-worthy. 
- time spent on planning, resetting objectives, doing risk analysis and prototyping may be excessive. 
- Relies on risk assessment expertise. 

#### when to use.
- risk perceived is very high. 
- requirements are complex. 
- significant changes are expected.

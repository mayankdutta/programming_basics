- proposed by Barry Bohem in 1986. 
- Diagrammatic representation of this model appears like spiral with many loops. 
- Spiral model is a framework & best suited for the projects which are risky. 
- has full phases such as planning, risk analysis, engineering & evaluation. 
- The software project repeatedly passes through these phases in a spiral formation. 
- Spiral combines feature of prototyping + waterfall. 
- favoured for large, expensive & complicated models. 
- suggested for high risk scenarios based projects. 

#### Adv 
- provides early indication risk. 
- users see the system early because of rapid prototyping tools. 
- critical high-risk functions are developed first.
- early and frequent feedback from users. 

#### Limitations 
- time spent for evaluating risks are too large for small or low-risks projects, may not prove cost-worthy. 
- time spent on planning, resetting objectives, doing risk analysis and prototyping may be excessive. 
- Relies on risk assessment expertise. 

#### when to use.
- risk perceived is very high. 
- requirements are complex. 
- significant changes are expected.

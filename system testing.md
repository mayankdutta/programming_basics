- performed on complete integrated system from end to end perspective. 
- conducted by testers to find if any diff between implementation & specification.
- **unbiased system testing** involves testing both functional & non-functional requirements. 
- **functional testing** verifies that each function of the application works as per the requirement specification. 
- **non-functional testing** checks the performance, accessibility, reliability & other requirements as specified in document. 
- System testing involves 
	- **functional testing**: test the implementation of the business needs. Each function work as per the requirement. 
	- **performance testing**: it will test all the non functional requirements of the system specified in the specification. checks performance, accessibility, reliability, *stability*, *response time*.
		- change load and measure response time. 
		- *stability*: how much people it can withstand. 
		- *response time*: 
		- *load*: no of users. 

##### performance testing
- **stress tests :** 
	- evaluates the system when stressed to its limits. 
	- aim is to test the system with the max to ensure it doesn't crash. 
- **regression tests :** 
	- required when system being tested is replacing an existing system.
	- replacement because of defect fixing & rectifying the defect. 
	- or enhancement of original system. 
	- explain it more clearly #todo 
- **usability tests :** 
	- testing characteristics related to user friendliness. 
	- done by user perspective. 
	- easy to understandable and impresses the user.
		- uncover design problems
		- learn about user's behaviour

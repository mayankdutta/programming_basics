- RAD model follows a component based approach. 
- individual component developed by *different people* & *assembled* to develop a large software system. 
- modules are developed in *parallel* as if they are *mini projects*. 
- *high speed* version of linear sequential model. 
- development is time boxed, delivered & then assembled into a working prototype. 
- based on the feedback, customer can provide feedback regarding the delivery & requirements. 

#### Traditional vs RAD 

- traditional model gives high importance to the analysis before the actual coding phase start. 
- After the coding part the customer can get the feel of the system.


- RAD does analysis quick design and develops the product incrementally & iteratively.
- main focus is on rapid delivery of software to the customer. 

#### Phases
1. **Business Modelling** information flow is identified b/w various modules. 
2. **Data Modelling** information gathered from business modelling is used to define data objects. 
3. **Process Modelling** data objects are converted to achieve the business objectives. 
4. **Application Modelling** Automated tools are used to convert process models into the actual system testing & turn over new components.
5. **Testing & Turnover** New components along with all interfaces tested.

#### adv 
- delivery of fully functional project in short period. 
- facilitates parallel development 

#### dis-adv
- dev & clients must be committed to rapid-fire activities. 
- not suitable for large projects as they would require more manpower for creating multiple RAD groups. 
- either party is indiff. in needs of other, the project will run into serious problem. 
#### when to use? 
- requirements are not fully understood
- user is involved throughout life cycle
- system can be modularized.

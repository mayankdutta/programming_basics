- RAD model follows a component based approach. 
- individual component developed by *different people* & *assembled* to develop a large software system. 
- modules are developed in parallel as if they are mini projects. 
- high speed version of linear sequential model. 
- development is time boxed, delivered & then assembled into a working prototype. 

#### Phases
1. Business modelling 
2. Data modelling 
3. process modelling 
4. application modelling 
5. testing & turnover 

#### adv 
- delivery of fully functional project in short period. 
- facilitates parallel development 

#### dis-adv
- dev & clients must be committed to rapid-fire activities. 
- not suitable for large projects. 
- either party is indiff. in needs of other, the project will run into serious problem. 


#### when to use? 
- requirements are not fully understood
- user is involved throughout life cycle
- system can be modularized.
